Here is the complete, detailed feature list for your **Mental Health Web App**. This is structured as a functional specification document that you can hand directly to a developer or designer.

---

### **1. Core Interface: The Daytime Dashboard**
*This is the "Home Page." It is designed for low-friction, continuous input throughout the day.*

* **The Quick-Capture Bar**
    * **Location:** Top center of the screen (like a social media status box).
    * **Function:** A simple text field with a "Post" button.
    * **Logic:**
        * User types a thought (e.g., "Feeling overwhelmed by the meeting").
        * Pressing "Enter" instantly saves the text with a hidden timestamp (e.g., 10:42 AM).
        * No pop-ups, no mood questions—just pure text capture to reduce effort.
* **The Live Journal Feed**
    * **Location:** Directly below the Capture Bar.
    * **Function:** A scrolling timeline of today’s entries.
    * **Display:** Each entry shows the Time (10:42 AM) and the Text.
    * **Editing:** Users can click any past entry to fix typos or add more context.
* **The AI Sidebar (The "Silent" Partner)**
    * **Location:** A collapsible panel on the right side of the screen.
    * **Function:**
        * **Passive Mode:** It reads the journal feed in real-time. If it detects high distress, it glows gently to offer help.
        * **Active Mode:** If clicked, it opens a chat window where the AI discusses the user's specific journal entries using "Active Listening" techniques (validating feelings without giving medical advice).

### **2. The Data Ritual: End-of-Day Wizard**
*This is a mandatory pop-up process that triggers at a set time (e.g., 9:00 PM) or when the user clicks "End Day." It standardizes the data.*

* **Step 1: Macro Mood (The Traffic Light)**
    * **Input:** User selects one of three large buttons:
        * 🔴 **Bad** (High Stress/Low Mood)
        * 🟡 **Okay** (Neutral/Stable)
        * 🟢 **Good** (Happy/Energetic)
    * **Purpose:** Establishes the baseline "vibe" for the day to compare against the specific triggers later.
* **Step 2: Trigger Frequency (The Counters)**
    * **Input:** A grid of 6–8 core emotion buttons (Anxiety, Anger, Sadness, Joy, Focus, Gratitude).
    * **Interaction:** Each button has a `(+)` and `(-)` stepper.
    * **Action:** User clicks `(+)` to count how many times they felt that specific emotion (e.g., Anxiety: 4 times).
    * **Purpose:** Turns abstract feelings into hard data (Integers) for the analytics engine.
* **Step 3: The Daily Lesson (Cognitive Closure)**
    * **Input:** A large text area with the prompt: *"What is one thing you learned about yourself today?"*
    * **Constraint:** User cannot finish the day without entering at least 5 words.
    * **Purpose:** Forces the brain to switch from "Experiencing" (feeling) to "Processing" (logic/learning).

### **3. The Engine: Performance & Metrics Logic**
*These are the calculations the system runs immediately after the user finishes the "End-of-Day Wizard."*

* **Metric A: The Volatility Index (Stability Score)**
    * **Definition:** Measures how "bumpy" the day was.
    * **Calculation:** Sum of all "High Energy" negative triggers (Anxiety + Anger + Panic).
    * **Output:**
        * 0–2: "Stable Day"
        * 3–5: "Rocky Day"
        * 6+: "High Volatility"
* **Metric B: The Dominant Driver**
    * **Definition:** Identifies the primary emotion of the day.
    * **Calculation:** Sorts all trigger counts from highest to lowest.
    * **Output:** "Your day was driven by **Anxiety** (35% of all triggers)."
* **Metric C: The Resilience Rating**
    * **Definition:** Measures the user's ability to find meaning in a bad day.
    * **Logic:**
        * If "Macro Mood" is **Bad** (Red)...
        * BUT "Daily Lesson" word count is **> 20 words** (High reflection)...
        * **Result:** High Resilience Score ("You had a tough day, but you processed it perfectly").

### **4. The Output: Analytics Dashboard**
*A separate "Stats" page where users can see their long-term health trends.*

* **The "Trigger Heatmap"**
    * **Visual:** A calendar view where each day is colored by its Macro Mood (Red/Yellow/Green).
    * **Detail:** Hovering over a day shows the "Dominant Driver" (e.g., "Oct 12: Red Day (Anger)").
* **The "Frequency" Bar Chart**
    * **Visual:** A bar chart showing the total counts of every emotion for the last 7 days.
    * **Insight:** Allows the user to see if "Anxiety" is trending up or down compared to last week.
* **The "Lesson Log"**
    * **Visual:** A list view of *only* the "Daily Lessons" from the past month.
    * **Purpose:** Reads like a book of wisdom the user wrote for themselves.

### **5. Tech & Security (Barebone Requirements)**
* **No-Login Access:**
    * The app loads immediately. Data is stored in the browser's **Local Storage** (IndexedDB).
    * **Benefit:** Zero barriers to entry; total privacy (data lives on the device).
* **Data Export:**
    * A simple "Download JSON" or "Download PDF" button so users can backup their journals or show them to a therapist.
* **Emergency Protocol:**
    * If the user logs "Self Harm" or "Suicide" keywords in the journal, the AI Assistant sidebar immediately changes color (Red) and displays a "Get Help" card with local hotline numbers.
