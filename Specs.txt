The application prompts the user at the end of each day with a guided review of their experience, asking for an overall assessment of the day, their general mood, the specific emotions they felt, and a tally of how many times each emotion was triggered. Throughout the day, the user can freely enter an unlimited number of journal entries. Once the daily reflection is complete, the application calculates their overall performance and provides various metrics. Finally, as part of the end-of-day process, the user is required to write journal entries detailing what they learned that day and the lessons they gathered.
